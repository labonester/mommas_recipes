    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 lb. hamburger meat</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 chopped tomato</li>
        <li>A couple tbsp of chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 cup uncooked rice</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a half pot of water to boil right away, then start preparing in a bowl</li>
        <li>Use your hands to mix these really good and make some meatballs about the size of your thumb and index finger in a circle, start throwing them in the water as you go. Cook the meat full boil for about 45 minutes to an hour before you start checking them. They are ready when the rice inside is soft (they can be cut in half to cook faster)</li>
        <li>As soon as the meatballs get thrown in the water, you can start preparing your veggies, cut to whatever size you want:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>3 medium sized potatoes (if you wash these really good, you don't have to peel them and don't cut them too small, that way they won't fall apart and turn to mush in the soup</li>
                <li>2 carrots</li>
                <li>2 zuchini</li>
                <li>2 stalks of celery</li>
            </ul>
        <li>If it seems like too many or not enough veggies, you can always put in more or less as you go. When the meat is ready, throw veggies in, add more water if you need to, throw in 2 or 3 of those beef cubes, 1 tbsp of salt and bring to a boil for about 20-30 minutes, it's done when veggies are soft enough to your taste, this is a good time to add more salt (if needed), because now all the flavor is mixed pretty good</li>
        <li>The rice is already in the soup so I don't make any, just squeeze a little bit of lime juice in your soup and you are set</li>
    </ol>
